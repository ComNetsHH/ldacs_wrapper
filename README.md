This repository is part of the L-Band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) Air-Air (A/A) mode simulator that implements the proposed Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol "Multi Channel Self-Organized TDMA (MCSOTDMA)".

This library implements the wrappers that are necessary to make the other libraries work in OMNeT++.
